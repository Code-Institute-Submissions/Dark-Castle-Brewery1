                <p class="mt-4 text-light mt-lg-0">It started over 10 years ago with a visit to Belgium in which we visited an abbey and saw first hand the creation of world class beer. On return to Ireland we hatched the crazy plan to start a brewery. A number of years of study mixed with a lot of experimentation followed! Finally we were then at a stage that we could expand! People outside our social circles liked what we were producing and we were in demand! A lot of blood, sweat and tears later we finally were able to start production! Dark Castle Brewery was formed! Influenced by the many fantasy books and films we grew up it. The art work in turn influenced by the pets (supervisors) Charlie and Kitler! </p>

<p class="mt-4 text-light mt-lg-0">We canâ€™t wait to see you again in person when the witches curse has been lifted (covid-19) and we can finally open our first bar! More on that in the coming months! </p>
