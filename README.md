## UX

### Project Goals ###

The **goal** for this project was to make an easy to use site that would allow a user to create a film review that they could share with other film buffs. A user could use the site to search for a list of comedies and possibly find a movie that they are interested in watching. Information about a particular movie is available including the platform that the movie was viewed. This would let  the vistor to the the site know how they could access the movie.

-  **Wireframes** for this project are available in the Mockups folder.

## Wireframing ##

 
Balsamiq was used for wireframing. This produced some basic wireframes, which were used to get an overall feeling for what would go where and how things would look on different screen sizes. Wireframes were created for mobile views firstly with the desktop views following.

**TODO Mockup's are available in the 'Mockups' folder.**

  
## TODO Features ##

**Features** that have been **implemented:**

* Easy to use **navigation** on all screen sizes.

* Popup modals are used if a logged in user wishes to delete a 'movie' as well as a 'helper' modal on the add/edit movie form instructing users on how to get a URL for an image.

*  **Attractive** design aimed at ease of use.

- Non logged in users have full read capability. They can scroll through and also search for movie(s).

- Logged-in users can create and edit 'movies'.

**Features** that will be **implemented** in the **future:**

##### Incorporate social media

* The ability to share a 'movie' via social media by incorporating social media platforms. For example, this would allow a user to post to instagram. Sharing this way would help increase the popularity of the site.

##### Option to add a youtube link to a movie trailer/clip

* The abilty to embed a movie trailer / clip into a movie card. This could be done by implimenting a youtube API and would be incorporated into the dedicated movie page.

##### Option to add comment section to movie cards

- Give users the abilty to leave comments on a particular movie. Controls would be put in place that would give the creator (or admin) of the review the option of enabling, deleting or flagging comments as well as allowing only friends to comment. etc

##### User profile

- Create a user profile. A user could provide basic information about themselves as well as being able to create lists e.g users top ten movies. User could also provide a profile image or select from a number of movie inspired images.

##### Rate other movies

- Rate other movies. The ratings that would then appear on a given movie will be based on a computation.

##### Curated top ten lists

* Feature top ten lists based on a season or an event, for example, Top ten Christmas movies around the holiday season or top ten Steven Spielberg movies on his birthday. These would be curated by the site owner.

##### Lost username/password support

- Provide support system for lost username / password.

##### Image optimisation

- Incorporate system for managing images that are uploaded by users that would enable them to be dynamically resized to specified size on load as well as compression. This would ensure that images are optimised for the site improving preformace.


##### Home page optimisation

- Currently the home page is one single page. As users add review cards the page grows in size. Two possible options to improve this are available.

  - Pagination. Limit the amount of cards to a particular page for example 4 per page.

  - Only load a set number of cards and as the user scrolls load another set of cards and so on.

# Deployment

The website is hosted via [GitHub](https://github.com/), with the source code being available on [my repository](https://github.com/Jammerref2015/watchthisnext).

### Requirements
-  **Python3** to run your application

-  **PIP** to install all app requirements

-  **IDE** of your choice - e.g Gitpod / Visual studio

- A **MongoDB Atlas** account for database development

### How To Access It

- In order to run this project locally you should follow these steps:

### Deployment to Heroku

#### The version hosted on Heroku (live version) is identical to the development version. 


1. Create a **requirements.txt** file by typing **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt** into the terminal line.

2. Create a Procfile by typing **echo web: python app.py > Procfile**.

3. Add, commit and push these changes to Github.

4. Navigate to the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
