## Defensive Design and Predicted Error Points

  

In this chapter, I will focus more on which steps I've taken to prevent predicted errors and complications. In the beginning, I focused

more on the actions that could break the site or site structure completely, and afterward more on restrictions that would make

sense for this project in general.

  
  
  

### Secured Admin Views

* Admin-related activities happening on the site, such as adding, editing, and deleting products or blog posts - are secured for superusers

* If a user still tries to access those pages, they are redirected to the homepage with a toast saying that only darkcastlebrewery team is allowed to do these actions

* This has achieved by:

* importing `@login_required` decorator in `views.py` files

* redirecting to the homepage

* displaying error toast message

  

### Search Queries Safe for Site Structure

* Firstly, if the query is an empty string, users are redirected to the webshop with a toast message

* long search queries without white spaces, or search queries that are simply too long, could break the site's responsiveness and structure so to prevent this the following actions have been taken:

* search box `<input>` is restricted to `maxlength="50"`

  

### User-Friendly Product Page Input

* Validation is in place to prevent a user from entering a number higher than 50 at a time. Previously it was possible to enter some infinite lengths.

* However there is currently no limit on the quantity amount one can add to the cart.

  

### Cart quantity updating

* A max number of 50 has been applied to the quantity field.

* This field is now also required to prevent a user from trying to update the cart with an empty field which resulted in Django error.

## Testing

  

The project's code was frequently validated through:

  

*  [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

	* The validator found some mistakes that were easy to fix, such as:

	* Incorrect `<footer>` tag had <footer">

	* Had some nnecessary type attribute `<script type="text/javascript">`

  

	* The following were not fixed due to the pressure of time.

	*  `<a>`is not allowed as child of element < ul > in this context.

	*  `<li>`is not allowed as child of element < nav > in this context x2.

	* Duplicate **id="user-options"** occurred because of additional implementation of custom widget template code. The pages for this app are built using code from the various apps (cart, products, etc) so there is some overlap which could explain the duplicate id's

	* A stray `<a>` tag was found.

	* The **aria-labelledby** attribute must point to an element in the same document.

*  [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

	* Base.css was tested. No errors were found.

	* Checkout.css was tested. No errors were found.

*  [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

	* stripe_elements.js was tested. No errors were found. Two warnings about 'template literal syntax' only available in ES6.

	* countryfield.js was tested. No errors were found. One warning about 'let' is available in ES6.

	* The script in quantity_input_script.html was tested. No errors. Three warnings about 'template literal syntax' only available in ES6.

	* Note:1 ('$' was not defined by JSHint however)

*  [PEP8 validator](http://pep8online.com/)

	* All Python code was run through the PEP8 validator

	* Most of the errors were `line too long`, `blank line contains whitespace`, and `blank line at end of file errors`, which I plan to correct at a later point since this isn't technically an error and this task would be very time-consuming at this point

  

The web app was tested on the devices and browsers listed below. I loaded the page on each of the device and browser combinations and looked for any visual and functional errors. I've also tried to resize the web pages on a desktop in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari developer tools to look for hidden irregularities and finding out the solutions. More about the errors I've encountered can be found under the 'Bugs, Problems and Vulnerabilities' section.

  

Desktop:

  

* iMac

* Google Chrome

* Safari

* Opera

* Firefox

  

Mobile:

  

* iPhone 6

* Safari

* Various android mobile phones

### User Testing Results

  

Apart from my efforts, the web app was tested by my friends and family members. The feedback was in general highly positive.

  

* Some small issues were discovered regarding UX.

* Products were displayed in random order. This was corrected by sorting the products by name.

* App was lacking shipping and return info. A modal popup was created to meet this need.

* Had an issue in which address 2 was outputting address 1 text and therefore repeating address 1. This was easily corrected. Address 1 and 2 now display the correct information.

* On mobile the cart information page was difficult to navigate. Adding some media queries addressed this issue.

  
  
  
  

I received some suggestions that I would have loved to implement but they would require more time, bigger code refactoring, or simply careful and detailed planning to achieve them.

  

Since none of these were bugs or errors and all my testers were able to navigate/use the app without the need for instruction I decided to leave them now to perhaps return to the app at a later date to finetune it further.

  

See the **README** for features I would like to add in the future.

  
  

### Bugs, Problems, and Vulnerabilities

  

## Bugs

  

### Cart

**Cart quantities**

* Had a bug in which a user could enter a possibly high number in the search field which could result in misuse

* The following code in cart.html was removed:

**// Update quantity on click

$('.update-link').click(function(e) {

var form = document.getElementById("form-update");

console.log(form);

if (form.reportValidity()){

form.submit();

}

});**

* In cart-quantity.html the - and + buttons were removed. The user can input an amount.

* The link to 'update' was replaced with an update button.

* HTML5 validation was placed on the input which had a min of 1 and a max of 50.

* An error occurred if you tried to update the card with an empty field. The solution used to prevent this was form validation. Trying to update with an empty field caused an alert to appear as did to try to enter a number greater than 50.

* It is still possible for a user to add an unlimited amount of a product(s). It might be a good idea to put some kind of limit to prevent this.

**Webhooks / emails**

  

* Had an issue that resulted in two emails being simultaneously being sent when a sale was completed. The email would be for the same order but the second email had a different order number and the pricing added various digits to the totals. Thanks to advice from a tutor I was able to discover what was happening.

* In **webhook_handler.py** I had two repeating lines of code which resulted in two emails being generated. Removing the second **self._send_confirmation_email(order)** resulted in just the one email sending. With the correct order information.

  

**Cross-Browser CSS Issues**

[Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to generate browser prefixes to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

  

**Login as superuser**

* Had an issue in which I could not log in as a superuser in Heroku.

* Solution was found on the slack group.

* I created a new Heroku-specific superuser and I was able to log in.

  

**iPhone specific cart details**

* When viewing the shopping cart on an i phone the credit card details field could get muddled making it impossible to read the text**
